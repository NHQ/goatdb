* [Pan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god), the half-goat god of ye fuckers.  Fertile, and loved by nymphs. Pan likes it natural, wild and musical. Curiously, Pan is one of only two Greek gods who die(d). The other one is the god of medicine and healing arts–perhaps a warning message for Westerners. According to me, according to wikipedia, according to Plutarch, Pan is killed by the news of Pan being killed.  That is, the transmission of information is the death of Pan.  (According to you!)  All other Gods die in the ironic form of that same method–the absence of tranmsisson... infertile information.  It is not ironic merely because of the simple affect of apparent contrass, such as between a t-shirt and its wearer.  It is ironic because it kills those death won't take naturally, while the opposite of that irony, by contrast, immortalizes many things which by nature die.
